## Description

Through research, I discovered that component Libraries are one of the huge advantages of working with React and a crucial part of building applications with React. I was able to build out this componet library using storybook and of course React! The components were replicated from mockups powered by adobe xd. Some of the components include buttons, forms, and thumbnails.
